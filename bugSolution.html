To avoid this issue, carefully examine your classes and their defined styles before applying them using `@apply`.  Refactor your classes to avoid naming conflicts or use a more selective approach to apply styles, perhaps separating them into distinct utility classes or using direct CSS where necessary.  

This example uses more explicit class names to avoid the conflict. Direct CSS application is also a good alternative to `@apply` when dealing with intricate style situations.

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 bg-blue-500-override"></div>
```

Or use a different, more explicit approach without `@apply`:

```html
<div style="background-color:red;"></div>
```
